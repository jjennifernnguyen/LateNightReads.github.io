            <h2>Song of Achilles
                <br>
                - Madison Miller
            </h2>
            <p>Alright, so The Story of Achilles is a retelling of Homer's Iliad, which is the story of the last year of the legendary Trojan War. Much of the original story does actually revolve around Achilles, but Miller's version not only zeroes in on this one character, it also stretches out the timeline a bit. In fact, we head all the way back to Achilles' childhood, but time slows down the closer we get to the end, so there are just some touches at first that lead to a fluidity.</p> 
            
            <p>And, surprise, this is the song of Achilles whose praise is not sung by himself or from his own perspective, but straight from the pen/lips of Patroclus. Who is Patroclus, you might ask. To simplify things, he's Achilles' best friend. But it's not that simple, or at least not always that simple. There was always some speculation that Patroclus and Achilles might have been a little more than BFFs, if you know what I mean. Some of the early writers portrayed Achilles and Patroclus as lovers and some did not.</p>
            
            <p>There is no “reality” to it because Achilles and Patroclus were never real people, but it is impossible to know what the original storyteller's conception of them was. Even Homer is not particularly clear about it. In The Iliad they are very close friends and comrades but there is no indication that they were more (which may have been due to a more nuanced conception of same-sex relationships in ancient Greece). Then again, at the given time in Greece (yes, they were in Troy but they were Greeks) male homosexual relationships were somewhat normative though along lines that were often different from what they might be today (like in apprentice-tutor “relationships” or on-the-side arrangements). </p>
            
            <p>I also find it hard to believe many of the modern interpretations of these relationships because of the nature of the dual-lens reading of “history” and everything that was left unsaid and is therefore assumed or speculated.</p>

            <h2>Battle of the Labyrinth 
                <br>
                - Rick Riordan
            </h2>
            <p>Second to the last book in the series! Battle of the Labyrinth was a fun and heartfelt read—with new characters, great plot twists, and a couple of moral lessons that will really stick with the reader.

            <p>There were new characters like Rachel Elizabeth Dare, Quintus, Briares, Calypso that really left an impression on me (I mean, they already did the first time I read the book, but it felt more significant this time). Loved that we got to see more of Nico and we saw just how his character developed in this book. When he was first introduced to the series, he was a hopeful young boy. Now, I'm excited to see more of him in the next books and series. And of course, the tension between Annabeth and Percy. Our main characters are entering teenage years and here come the feelings. Percy was so daft, it's endearing.</p>
                
            <p>I also love how there were a couple of plot twists that I still missed. I mean, I read this book years ago, so I guess my memory is now kind of fuzzy. But wow, Riordan really never fails to surprise me. I love it!</p>   
                
            <p>Also, when I first read this book, I never quite realised just how much of a theme the environment was in the story. Grover's journey, Pan's message, everything was so heartbreaking and enlightening as to how humans are treating and should be treating the wild, the earth.</p>
                
            <p>“The wild, my dear Grover, is so small now, so shattered, that no god can save it.”</p>
                
            <p>“Remake the wild, a little at a time, each in your own corner of the world. You cannot wait for anyone else, even a god, to do that for you.”</p>
                
            <p>Another theme that was a highlight for me in this book is family. With Sally meeting Paul, Daedalus with his son and his nephew, the tales about Hera and her “family”, Nico and her sister Bianca, and even Rachel with her dad or Dionysus with his sons. All of these parts involved family—both the good, the bad, and the ugly—and I really adored that.</p>
                
            <p>I really loved this one. It was probably my favourite one out of this series.</p>

            <h2>The Maze Runner
                <br>
                - James Dashner
            </h2>
            <p>The story is set in the future, where a group of young boys are mysteriously taken into a giant, stone maze. Not only has their memory been cleared, but they also have no indication as to why they have ended up in this position and what means they must take to escape.</p>

            <p>Their situation complicates even further, given that the maze doors close every evening. During the night, vicious monsters roam free and devour anything in their way. The boys, who call themselves “Grovers”, attempt to map the maze, but doing so poses obvious threats to their safety.</p>
                
            <p>Enter Thomas, a new “Grover” arriving in the maze. As he learns his way about this new reality, the story follows his point of view in first person perspective. Thomas eventually comes to terms with living as a Grover, but one night, as he crosses into the outer layer of the maze, his world is turned inside out.</p>
                
            <p>Over time, Thomas must confront these imminent struggles, while also attempting to solve the grand puzzle of the maze. Readers are kept on edge through the entire novel, with hidden twists and turns on every turn of the chapter.</p>
                
            <p>I would certainly recommend this read for teens and adults alike. While it’s true that the novel is aimed at a young demographic, its plot is engaging for even some of the most mature readers. The ending simply cannot be predicted, leaving readers to make their own speculations about the mysterious origins of the maze.</p>
                
            <p>One complaint I might file is that there is somewhat of a lack of character development. The plot is so action-packed that it would see Dashner decided to leave out some of the more subtle nuances of a good novel.</p>
                
            <p>If you decide to not read this novel, I would suggest reading “The Lord of the Flies” by William Golding. The plot bears some parallels to that of the Maze Runner.</p>
                
            <p>Overall, “The Maze Runner” stands to be a top-quality post-apocalyptic teen-novel, making for an engaging read. The story sheds light on the natural instincts of teens under true isolation. In doing so, it echoes a number of themes which leave readers to draw meaningful questions about life, nature, and the purpose of humanity.</p>

  <p>I had never heard of this book until I saw As Above, So Below, a horror film from 2014. I watched a video where the person was breaking down certain scenes of the film and talking about how it references Dante's inferno which comes from the Divine Comedy. I thought why not, let's read the book and see where the references are being made in the film...</p>

  <br>
  <br>

  <p>"Translated in this edition by Allen Mandelbaum, The Divine Comedy begins in a shadowed forest on Good Friday in the year 1300. It proceeds on a journey that, in its intense recreation of the depths and the heights of human experience, has become the key with which Western civilization has sought to unlock the mystery of its own identity. Mandelbaum's astonishingly Dantean translation, which captures so much of the life of the original, renders whole for us the masterpiece of that genius whom our greatest poets have recognized as a central model for all poets." -GoodReads.</p>
