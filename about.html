        <p>Hi there! This is Jennifer, but everyone calls me Jenn. I quite enjoy reading books whenever I have the opportunity to. Amongst many things, I believe reading makes for a great hobby and a nice pass time activity. I love spending time with my family and friends as well as playing sports.</p>
        
        <p>I am set to graduate in December 2022 from The University of Texas at Dallas with a B.S. in Information Technology and Systems. As of right now, this blog is something I like to do in my free time!</p>    

        <p>People are always surprised when they discover that I enjoy reading, and I always get the question, “What is your favorite book?” Well, that is a tricky question to answer. I usually reply to that question with just books I enjoyed growing up as a kid. Those are the books that led me to enjoy reading as I grew older.</p>

        <p>The first book or, well, series would be the Percy Jackson series written by Rick Riordan. The way Riordan was able to adapt the famous Greek mythology stories to allow kids to better understand the ancient stories made me fall in love with Greek mythology itself. I branched out from Greek mythology and began reading mythological stories from other cultures, Roman, Egyptian, etc.</p>
            
        <p>The second book is The Alchemist written by Paulo Coehlo. The Alchemist was a story I read during my freshman year of high school. It was actually a required school reading, but regardless, it showed me some important life lessons. One of the quotes I recall from the book is, "the secret to life though, is to fall seven times and to get up the eighth time" -The Alchemist. I believe the quote speaks for itself.</p>

        <p>I hope you have enjoyed reading through the blog! Thank you for visiting!</p>
